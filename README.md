# Book Search Engine

## Description

This application was created for users that love to read. in this application, users that are logged in can search for book titles and authors to recieve results for their search. Using Apollo GraphQl to make this possible. building this project was geared towards the bookworms that love to read and want a dedicated search engine for books and authors of their liking ad interests. Within thiw application, users can only save the books that they have found by having an account, same goes with the deletion of said books in their saved inventory. From this project, I learned how to use Apollo Graphql which replaced the RESTful API from my past.
